 # Project Title

A implementation of the 74181 integrated circuit

## Description

This is project I'm working on to gain more experience in writing SystemVerilog and test benches. I intend to make a fully functioning 74181 ALU chip with all 32 functions implemented properly.


## Future Plans

After the completion of this project, I intend to implement the 74182 circuit next.
